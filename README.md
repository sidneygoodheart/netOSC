# netOSC: A System for Cross-Network OSC Communication

netOSC is a small experimental project exploring the use of Open Sound Control (OSC) for network-based communication in distributed interactive systems.

The project provides a minimal OSC-based infrastructure consisting of a server and a client-side bridge. The server acts as a central broker, while the client bridges any OSC-capable application in a local network to the broker server.

The focus of the project is on message forwarding, network transparency, and practical deployment scenarios rather than feature completeness.
